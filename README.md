# [Cracking the code Interview](http://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/) Problems Solved
This repository has the way I solved some of the problems from the book of Cracking the Code Interview written by [Gayle Laakmann McDowell](linkedin.com/in/gaylemcd).

It also has some comments of the descriptions of the algorithms I used, and some explanations of Complexity.

# How to run it
1. Clone this repository
2. Install [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org)
3. Go to the root of the repository in your command line
4. You could run any problem solution just by doing `node run 1.4` where **1.4** is the number of a problem.
